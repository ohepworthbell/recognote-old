# Recognote #

A small, self-contained, HTML-JS web app for practicing note recognotion.

### Install instructions ###

```node
cd /path/to/project/
npm install
```
Then map a virtual host to your environment (e.g. add `http://recognote.local` to hosts). Alternatively, if you are unable to run this app locally, you can view the demo site [here](https://recognote.wearegrowth.com/)

### Demo using http-server ###

In node 5.2.0+ you can also demo the website using `http-server`, like so:

```node
cd dist/
npx http-server -o
```

### To do ###

This app is still in its primacy, so there are a number of quite wide-ranging `@todo` tasks. Principally:
*   Add button to social media for native sharing; fix non-native sharing so that a message is included when shared
*   Add `dist/*.html` to `.gitignore` as these files are compiled anyway, and so don't need to be committed
*   Add `ocataveMultiplier` test to AVA
*   Add `active` state/class to navbar for current view
*   Add 'how to play' modal with instructions
*   Add tooltip to difficulty toggle to explain difference in modes
*   ~~Loading animations~~
    *   ~~On initial load, coloured bar starts at outer perimetre and traverses the canvas to indicate percent loaded. Individual notes are hidden during this process~~
    *   ~~Once fully loaded, the 'loading' bar 'shrinks' to final position, and gives a small 'ripple' whilst the answers fade into view, to indicate the app it ready to play~~
    * ***NOTE:** As all sound will be generated by JavaScript, there will be no loading required. Instead, perhaps have initial 'play' button show as outlined button, with outline morphing into canvas shape*
*   Add icon to center to indicate playback
*   ~~Add and expand tests (AVA)~~
*   Properly attach answer buttons to canvas (either as part of canvas, or add `resize` listener to scale buttons accordingly with canvas)
*   Add animation for correct/incorrect answer
    *   Perhaps tick/cross that scales out from center of screen
    *   Small, red notice underneath that states the correct answer if an incorrect answer is selected
*   Add sharing screen/options
*   ~~Add tallying ability, and storage of 'best streak' in localStorage for persistence~~
*   ~~Add audio files for playing sound~~
*   Add ability to switch instruments (first instrument free, additional instruments charged)
*   Add menu for toggling the instruments/~~modes~~
*   Add mode for easy/hard/chords (the difference between easy and hard will be the inclusion of sharp/flat notes)
*   Add all JS, CSS, HTML, audio results to the service worker to allow for offline mode
*   ~~Add node server for running the web-app without setting up a virtual host~~
*   Add success/error noise for answer (ping for success, horn for error) for better feedback; highlight selected answer in green if correct, in red if incorrect and correct answer in green
